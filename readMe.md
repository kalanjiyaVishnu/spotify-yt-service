## spotify youtube playlist service

### **work in progress**

    [1] connect to get spotify playlist for user.
    [1] download youtube video for a search query.
    [0] make it as service (user,files,etc.)
    [0] create ui to navigate playlist songs and able to view and download via youtube || connnect to find lyrics.

### things havnt figured out yet
- the flow follows from login with spotify to dowlnoad all songs in youtbe. No separate api's 
- no ui 
- search api for youtube is limited 10000 per day.
- handling file when user scale up. 

#### why

- i want to listen to my spotify playlist offline.
- used youtube api to search and dowload songs.
- need to migrate spotify to youtube playlist.
